/*************************A NOTE ON GENERAL COMMENTING**************************
 * class name/ path is notated by that thing at the top of this class, if the
 * class is a main, ">>Main" will be in the top right corner (like above)
 *
 * comments depend on how log each line is
 * each line in this program is attempted to stay on one line for each page
 * for readability, pleasing graders, etc...
 * Block comments are in the Netbeans/javadoc style, and are generally put
 *     before methods
 * lines that are too long in block comments are tabbed in (see â†‘), (if the line
 *     is independent. if the block comment is a paragraph, the comment is one
 *     big block.)
 *
 * line comments are different from what you'll normally expect (maybe), but
 *     it's a system I like. Instead of explaining everything, i'll give some
 *     examples (i'm sure you'll understand)
 *
 * line of code 1;//comment 1
 *
 * really really really really really really really long line of code 2;
 *     //comment 2
 *
 * really really really really really really really really really long line of
 *     code 3;
 *         //comment 3
 *
 * line of code 4;
 *     //really really really really really really really really long comment 4
 *
 * line of code 5;
 *     //really really really really really really really really really long
 *     //comment 5
 *
 * really really really really really really really really really long line of
 *     code 6;
 *         //really really really really really really really really really long
 *         //comment 5
 *
 * each tab is (and probably all is) four spaces wide
 *
 * a note on V 3.0 commenting: not all of the speling is checked/corected :)
 *
 * another note on comments:
 *      @version Is the version number of the specific class.
 *               Version number goes up if the program is modified
 *      @author  Is the author of the code (me) notated as "Kieda"
 *      @since   Is the the last day the class was edited (including comments!)
 * *******************TOTAL LINES IN THIS PROJECT: alot and counting************
