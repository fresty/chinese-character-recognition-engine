VERSION BETA 2.6

Updating existing algorithms to be more efficient
i.e. intersections are only counted for each individual stroke that intersects the line
Currently, simple/complex don't matter
and...
Intersections are only counted by the number of differents strokes that pass through them (removing accidental extra intersections)
changed the "delta" for the amount the mouse has to move to add a point to 1 (the line above me explains why this will be no problem!)
made the components resize better than before
added more characters to the database
the cursor is a crosshair when above the drawpanel
INTERESTING NOTE:THE SPEED OF THE PROGRAM ROSE TENFOLD OR SOMETHING WHEN THE USB WAS UNPLUGGED, HAVE TO INVESTIGATE FURTHER
SECOND INTERESTING NOTE: SPEED WAS INCREASED AFTER THE LOGS WERE EMPTIED, WILL FIND MORE EFFICIENT WAY TO WRITE TO FILES

Speed problem fixed by remodeling the LogManager and fixing the index

Database now has definitions in it, and found characters show definitions
