I would like to thank the Oracle Corporation/ the Netbeans IDE
for not onl their excellent IDE, but also for generated swing code 
in the preliminary steps (beginning alpha) of this project. Their 
use of GroupLayout further inspired me to use GroupLayout manually
in other swing operations.

I would also like to thank Oracle for the excellent JDK platform,
this program would not run if it were'nt for JAVA
